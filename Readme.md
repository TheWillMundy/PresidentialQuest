# Presidential Quest

_Think you know our presidents? Think again._

Imagine this: your name is Thomas Jefferson, and you've just received word that Aaron Burr is
planning to create a new country within your borders. What do you do? Do you sit back and watch as
your former Vice-President takes your land? Or do you fight for your country by answering his Presidential
Trivia?

_We hope you chose the latter._

Presidential Quest is a game for all ages which will test your knowledge of all 45 Presidents through
a fun game setting. All information contained in the game is factually accurate, and will be great
discussion-starters at the dinner table.

**_So what are you waiting for? Go save the Union!_**
